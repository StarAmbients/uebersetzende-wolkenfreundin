## 🎓 Academic Depth, Applied Vision

My path began in the intersection of **mathematics, computation, and logic**, where I learned that elegant theory has little value unless it can be *implemented, tested, and shared*.
I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and have conducted research in **Artificial Intelligence and Computational Systems** at world-renowned institutions:

- **University of Trento (Italy)**
- **Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems (Germany)**
- **CNRS / LIP6 – Université Paris VI (France)**

This academic foundation shaped my conviction that **AI must be reproducible, explainable, and ethically aligned** — principles that guide my engineering and leadership today.

## 🧠 From Research to Engineering Leadership

Over two decades of teaching, mentoring, and research, I developed the ability to turn complex theoretical problems into **structured, documented, and maintainable systems**.
Transitioning from academia to industry, I realized that my greatest contribution lies in combining **scientific rigor with engineering clarity**.

As an **AI Tech Lead**, my priorities are:

- **Clarity before complexity** – every developer should understand the system they’re building.
- **Reproducibility as culture** – documentation is not decoration; it’s the foundation of trust.
- **Automation with empathy** – the right tools should free teams to think, not to struggle.
- **Continuous improvement** – engineering is iterative learning, done collaboratively.

I have learned that leading a technical project means **facilitating flow**: ensuring that processes, tools, and communication work so efficiently that creativity can thrive.

## 🧩 Building Teams that Think Scientifically

My leadership philosophy is shaped by years of supervising students and collaborating with research teams across Europe and Brazil.
I bring the same structure and patience that teaching requires into technical environments — helping teams not just deliver, but *understand what they’re delivering.*

I believe that:
- **Documentation is inclusion.**
  It allows anyone, from a new graduate to a senior engineer, to contribute meaningfully.
- **Good processes protect good moods.**
  Automation reduces stress, letting people focus on what truly matters: innovation and purpose.
- **Human and artificial intelligence must coevolve ethically.**
  Systems we build should amplify integrity and competence, not chaos or bias.

## 🌐 Vision for Large-Scale AI Work

My next professional goal is to contribute to **global, interdisciplinary AI projects** within a mature enterprise or research organization — where **clarity, reproducibility, and ethics** are part of the engineering DNA.

I bring:
- Proven experience in **machine learning workflows**, **cloud architecture**, and **AI project delivery**.
- A background that connects **scientific research with real-world engineering execution**.
- A leadership style that makes complex projects understandable, measurable, and sustainable.

> *My mission is to lead AI systems that serve people — with clarity, precision, and joy in collaboration.*
